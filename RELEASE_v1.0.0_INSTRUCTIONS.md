# Release v1.0.0 - Final Steps

## ✅ Completed Work

All preparation is complete:
- ✅ XCFramework built (8.5MB - 93% smaller!)
- ✅ Carthage support added
- ✅ All documentation updated
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD configured
- ✅ All workflow failures fixed
- ✅ Tag v1.0.0 created and pushed

## 📋 Remaining Steps (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Set up CocoaPods Token (One-time setup)

1. **Get your CocoaPods token:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.netrc | grep cocoapods.org -A 2
   ```

   You'll see:
   ```
   machine trunk.cocoapods.org
     login aviavi23@gmail.com
     password YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

   Copy the token (the `password` value).

2. **Add GitHub Secret:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/snooky23/Spectra/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click **"New repository secret"**
   - Name: `COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste your token
   - Click **"Add secret"**

### Step 2: Trigger the Release

Since tag v1.0.0 already exists, we need to re-trigger the workflow:

**Option A: Delete and Re-push Tag** (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Delete local tag
git tag -d v1.0.0

# 2. Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0

# 3. Re-create and push tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 - Production-ready logging framework"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Option B: Manual Re-run** (If Option A fails)

1. Go to: https://github.com/snooky23/Spectra/actions
2. Find the "Release" workflow run for v1.0.0
3. Click "Re-run all jobs"

### Step 3: Watch It Work! 🚀

1. **Monitor the workflow:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/snooky23/Spectra/actions
   - Watch the "Release" workflow run (~5 minutes)

2. **What happens automatically:**
   - ✅ Builds XCFramework for all architectures
   - ✅ Creates ZIP and calculates checksum
   - ✅ Creates GitHub Release with beautiful notes
   - ✅ Uploads XCFramework asset
   - ✅ Publishes SpectraLogger to CocoaPods
   - ✅ Publishes SpectraLoggerUI to CocoaPods

3. **Verify when complete:**
   - GitHub Release: https://github.com/snooky23/Spectra/releases/tag/v1.0.0
   - CocoaPods: https://cocoapods.org/pods/SpectraLogger
   - CocoaPods UI: https://cocoapods.org/pods/SpectraLoggerUI

## 🎉 What You'll Have

Once complete, users can install via:

### Swift Package Manager
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/snooky23/Spectra.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### CocoaPods
```ruby
pod 'SpectraLogger', '~> 1.0'
pod 'SpectraLoggerUI', '~> 1.0'
```

### Carthage
```ruby
binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snooky23/Spectra/main/SpectraLogger.json" ~> 1.0
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If release workflow fails:

1. **Check the logs:**
   - https://github.com/snooky23/Spectra/actions
   - Click the failed run to see error details

2. **Common issues:**
   - **Token invalid:** Re-check the COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN secret
   - **Build fails:** Check if all dependencies are in build.gradle.kts
   - **XCFramework error:** Ensure xcodebuild is available on macos-latest runner

3. **Get help:**
   - Check: `/Users/avilevin/Workspace/Personal/Spectra/docs/CICD_SETUP.md`
   - Or ask me!

## 🚀 Next Release (v1.0.1, v1.1.0, etc.)

For future releases, it's even easier:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add awesome feature"
git push

# 2. Create and push a tag
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release v1.0.1"
git push origin v1.0.1

# 3. That's it! CI/CD does the rest automatically!
```
