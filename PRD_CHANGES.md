# PRD Update Summary

## Changes Made to Support KMP Projects

The PRD has been updated to explicitly include **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) projects** as a primary target alongside native iOS and Android applications.

### Key Updates:

#### 1. **Project Description** (Section 1)
- Updated to state framework works for "iOS, Android, and KMP projects"
- Added three distribution methods:
  - Native iOS projects (XCFramework)
  - Native Android projects (AAR)
  - **KMP projects (KMP module via Maven)**

#### 2. **Project Goals** (Section 1)
- Updated tertiary goal to include KMP projects
- Emphasized easy integration across all three project types

#### 3. **Value Proposition** (Section 1)
Added KMP-specific benefits:
- **True multiplatform**: Works in native iOS, native Android, AND KMP projects
- **Native-first**: Can integrate into existing native projects without KMP migration
- **KMP-optimized**: Direct dependency for KMP projects without wrapper code

#### 4. **Target Audience** (Section 2)
Expanded primary audience to include:
- KMP developers building multiplatform mobile applications
- Teams migrating from native to KMP
- Teams maintaining hybrid codebases (native + KMP)

#### 5. **User Personas** (Section 2)
**Added Persona 4: Dmitri - KMP Developer**
- 30 years old, 6 years Kotlin, 2 years KMP experience
- **Pain points**:
  - Limited logging options that work across all KMP targets
  - Existing solutions require separate native wrappers for iOS
  - Difficulty debugging shared KMP code on iOS devices
  - Network logging requires platform-specific implementations
- **Goals**:
  - Single logging API in commonMain code
  - View logs from shared KMP code on both platforms
  - Debug network issues in shared networking layer
  - Easy integration without native bridging

#### 6. **Network Logging** (Section 3.1)
Added support for **Ktor client plugin**:
- NFR-3.4: Support for Ktor client (KMP projects)
- Platform-specific implementation now includes:
  - Native Android: OkHttp Interceptor
  - Native iOS: URLProtocol
  - **KMP Projects: Ktor client plugin (cross-platform)**

#### 7. **Distribution** (Section 4.4)
Clarified three distribution strategies:

**For KMP Projects**:
- Maven repository
- Single artifact: `com.spectra:logger:1.0.0`
- Direct dependency in `commonMain`
- No platform-specific wrappers needed

**For Native Android**:
- Android-specific artifact: `com.spectra:logger-android:1.0.0`
- Pre-compiled KMP code + Android UI

**For Native iOS**:
- CocoaPods, SPM, or XCFramework
- Pre-compiled KMP code + iOS UI

#### 8. **API Examples** (Appendix A)
Added comprehensive KMP integration examples:

**Basic Integration**:
```kotlin
// KMP Project - shared/build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            implementation("com.spectra:logger:1.0.0")
        }
    }
}
```

**KMP Shared Code Usage**:
```kotlin
// In shared/src/commonMain/kotlin
class UserRepository {
    private val logger = SpectraLogger.getLogger("UserRepository", "data")

    suspend fun fetchUser(userId: String): Result<User> {
        logger.debug("Fetching user", mapOf("userId" to userId))
        // ... implementation
    }
}

// Ktor client integration
val httpClient = HttpClient {
    install(SpectraNetworkPlugin)
}
```

**Showing UI from KMP**:
```kotlin
// expect/actual pattern for showing UI from shared code
expect fun showSpectraUI()

fun onDebugMenuTapped() {
    showSpectraUI()
}
```

#### 9. **Competitive Analysis** (Appendix B)
Enhanced comparison table with KMP-specific features:
- Added row: "Native project support" (Spectra supports all)
- Added row: "KMP direct integration" (Spectra + Napier only)
- Added row: "Ktor client plugin" (Spectra only)

Shows Spectra Logger as the **only solution** that supports:
✅ Native iOS projects
✅ Native Android projects
✅ KMP projects with direct integration
✅ On-device UI
✅ Network logging with Ktor support

## Why These Changes Matter

### 1. **Broader Target Market**
- KMP adoption is growing rapidly (Google, Netflix, VMware, Cash App)
- Many teams are in hybrid state (native + KMP)
- Framework can serve all three audiences without compromise

### 2. **Unique Value Proposition**
Spectra Logger is now positioned as the **only** logging solution that:
- Works natively in pure iOS projects (Swift/Objective-C)
- Works natively in pure Android projects (Kotlin/Java)
- Works natively in KMP projects (commonMain)
- Provides on-device UI for all three
- Includes network logging for all three

### 3. **No Migration Required**
- Native iOS team can adopt independently
- Native Android team can adopt independently
- KMP team can adopt in shared code
- Later, if teams migrate to KMP, same logger works without changes

### 4. **KMP Best Practices**
- Direct `commonMain` dependency (no expect/actual wrapper needed)
- Ktor plugin for network logging (multiplatform HTTP client)
- Platform-specific UI presentation via expect/actual
- Example code demonstrates proper KMP patterns

---

## Next Steps

With these PRD updates, the framework is now positioned as a **universal mobile logging solution** that works across all modern mobile development approaches:

1. ✅ **Native iOS** - for Swift/Objective-C teams
2. ✅ **Native Android** - for Kotlin/Java teams
3. ✅ **KMP** - for multiplatform teams

This significantly expands the addressable market and makes Spectra Logger relevant to:
- Pure native teams
- Pure KMP teams
- Hybrid teams (most common in practice)
- Teams migrating from native to KMP

The framework can be developed once and serve all three audiences without maintaining separate codebases.
